                                <h3>African coffee culture has recently been brewing up a storm. A heightened growth in
                                        strong,
                                        domestic consumer markets have been seen, as well as an increase in café culture
                                        within
                                        Africa’s urban areas. With about half a trillion hot cups consumed per year,
                                        coffee is
                                        the world’s second most traded commodity- following oil. As the third most
                                        consumed
                                        beverage after water and tea, coffee has also been able to maintain its spot as
                                        one of
                                        the world’s top commodities. Due to its popularity, coffee beans are in high
                                        demand
                                        everywhere, and coffee brands are continuously striving to surpass their mark in

                                        competitive market.</h3>

                                <h3>Fruit and vegetables (F&V) have been a cornerstone of healthy dietary
                                        recommendations; the
                                        2015–2020 U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that F&V constitute
                                        one-half
                                        of the plate at each meal. F&V include a diverse collection of plant foods that
                                        vary in
                                        their energy, nutrient, and dietary bioactive contents. F&V have potential
                                        health-promoting effects beyond providing basic nutrition needs in humans,
                                        including
                                        their role in reducing inflammation and their potential preventive effects on
                                        various
                                        chronic disease states leading to decreases in years lost due to premature
                                        mortality and
                                        years lived with disability/morbidity. Current global intakes of F&V are well
                                        below
                                        recommendations. Given the importance of F&V for health, public policies that
                                        promote
                                        dietary interventions to help increase F&V intake are warranted.</h3>

                                <h3> Some of the best pizza around hands down. Really fresh and well made. Not ever over
                                        or
                                        under cooked. They’ve somehow managed to make it the perfect middle. I highly
                                        recommend
                                        them here! The quintessential New York style slice, still cooked in one of the
                                        last
                                        coal-fired ovens in the city! This pizza may sound underwhelming on the outside,
                                        but
                                        don’t let the simplicity foul you. The genius here is in the balance and
                                        execution of
                                        the few ingredients involved. Don’t be tempted to stray for the regular pie as
                                        this is
                                        where you get the full experience. Go and enjoy this American classic!</h3>
